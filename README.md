# ‚úàÔ∏è Airport Ticket Booking System (SQL Server | 3NF Normalized)

This project is a comprehensive **Airport Ticket Booking System** developed using **Microsoft SQL Server**, designed with strict adherence to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** principles. It efficiently handles flight reservations, secure logins, passenger updates, and employee operations with strong data validation and security measures in place.

## üìö What This Project Does

The system begins with designing and creating a fully normalized database schema with well-defined relationships, constraints, and validations. All objects were created with **referential integrity**, **data validation checks**, and logical rules ‚Äî such as validating email formats, checking date of birth constraints, enforcing valid class types, and ensuring proper associations between passengers, flights, and employees.

A detailed **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** was constructed to visualize relationships and ensure normalization rules were followed, removing redundancy and enforcing dependency on primary keys only.

Authentication is handled via a **secure login procedure** for employees. Passwords are **hashed and salted** using `SHA2_256` via SQL Server's `HASHBYTES()` function. Although a static salt is currently used, it ensures credentials are stored securely and prevents plaintext vulnerabilities.

To support the boarding process, a stored procedure generates **unique boarding numbers** by combining internal identifiers with a deterministic hash component, ensuring uniqueness even during concurrent operations. These are stored in a separate table for streamlined boarding workflows.

Security is a key focus of this system:
- Passwords are stored as secure hashes.
- `HASHBYTES` with `SHA2_256` is used for encryption.
- Salting is used to enhance hash uniqueness.

To test and demonstrate functionality, several real-world **use case queries** were implemented:
 
  **Search** for passengers by last name, with the most recent bookings listed first.

  Retrieve **meal preferences** for business class passengers who booked today.

View **revenue and boarding activity** grouped by employee.

 Use a **trigger** to automatically update seat availability when a booking is made.

 Generate **baggage count reports** by flight and booking date.

These queries validate that the system operates as expected and support operational airport workflows in a scalable and secure manner.
